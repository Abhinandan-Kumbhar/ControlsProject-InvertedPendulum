## Summary
### Problem

Consider a modified scenario where the pivot of the pendulum is attached to the top a cart that can move along the x-direction as shown in the figure. 
The cart is driven by an engine which exerts a horizontal force  F . in addition, the cart also experiences a resistance  f  due to its motion.  
An LQR controller needs to be designed for regulating the force exerted, so that the pendulum can be stabilized in the inverted position. 
The controller should work even if the pendulum is off the vertical or the cart is moving initially.
